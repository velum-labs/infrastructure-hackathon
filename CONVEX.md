# Save registrations in Convex

The form sends a team through `submitTeam` in `src/apply/submit.ts`. That calls the `applications.submit` mutation in `convex/applications.ts`.

The mutation stores one `applications` row for the team and one `members` row per person. Same email, or same GitHub when they gave one, is rejected. There is no public query for these rows. Read them in the Convex dashboard, on the Data page.

`VITE_CONVEX_URL` must be present at build time. Without it, the form shows its retry state and preserves the draft instead of claiming that the team was saved.

## Local

This repository is linked to the Convex project `vicente-matus/infra-futuro-velum-indies` and its personal development deployment `greedy-gecko-110`. The Convex CLI writes `.env.local` in the repo root when you select that deployment; the file is gitignored.

```bash
pnpm exec convex deployment select greedy-gecko-110
pnpm exec convex dev --once
```

Run `pnpm exec convex dev` instead of `--once` to keep functions in sync while editing. The selected deployment uses:

```bash
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:greedy-gecko-110
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://greedy-gecko-110.convex.cloud
```

For a different development deployment, create `.env.local` in the repo root with its name and URL:

```bash
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment-name.convex.cloud
```

`your-deployment-name` is the dev deployment name from the Convex dashboard (Settings on that deployment). It is the subdomain of the URL. For a deployment named `happy-animal-123`:

```bash
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:happy-animal-123
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud
```

If you do not have a project yet, this writes the file for you:

```bash
pnpm exec convex dev
```

Log in with GitHub when it asks, and create the project. Leave that command running while you work. It uploads `convex/` and generates `convex/_generated`. Commit `convex/_generated` after it appears. `pnpm build` typechecks the functions from those files.

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Submit a team at `/apply` and confirm the rows in the dashboard.

To upload functions without the browser login, add a dev deploy key to `.env.local` as `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`. Create it in the dashboard under deploy keys. Keep that value out of git and out of chat.

## Production

The project's production Convex deployment is `polite-spider-810` at `https://polite-spider-810.convex.cloud`. The development deployment above does not configure production.

To save live registrations:

1. Deploy the canonical `main` branch again. The production `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` sets the public production URL as `VITE_CONVEX_URL` while building Vite. This needs no Vercel secret or dashboard setting.
2. Submit a representative team on the published site and confirm one `applications` row and the linked `members` rows in the production Convex Data page.

The current `applications.submit` function was deployed manually on 5 October 2026. Future changes under `convex/` must be deployed separately with `pnpm exec convex deploy` before the matching frontend release. Preview builds run `pnpm build` without a Convex URL; configure a separate preview backend and `VITE_CONVEX_URL` for previews if submission testing is needed there.

After saving a team, the mutation schedules an internal action for each member. The action sends a confirmation through the official Resend SDK from `Infra Futuro <hola@indies.la>`. `indies.la` must stay verified for sending in Resend. Each message uses the member ID as its Resend idempotency key.

Set `RESEND_API_KEY` separately on the selected development deployment and on production with `pnpm exec convex env set RESEND_API_KEY` before testing or accepting live registrations. The key in `.env.local` is only available to local CLI commands; it is not automatically available to Convex cloud functions. Keep it out of Git, Vercel, and Vite environment variables. Check sends and delivery events with the Resend CLI (`resend emails list` and `resend emails get <id>`). The form confirms the saved registration before the scheduled email action finishes, so use Resend events to verify delivery.
